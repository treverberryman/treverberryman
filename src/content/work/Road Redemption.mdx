[<u>Road Redemption</u>‚Üó](https://store.steampowered.com/app/300380/Road_Redemption/) lets you lead a biker gang on an epic journey across the country in a driving combat road rage adventure. Earn money, loot and weapons by completing races, assassinations, robberies, and other challenges in your path.

  One large contribution I assisted with was designing the lead biker villain, ‚ÄúThe Assassin‚Äù. I helped iterate on his gameplay, example dialogue, and the mission you fight them on. Feedback from the lead engineer helped me understand how design can impact the time cost and financial cost of a project‚Äôs budget.

  <p>One of my key responsibilities was to search for and fix bugs using C# scripting. This process taught me a huge amount about extensible code and how to use a working codebase.</p>

  <p>I also learned about optimizing models for performance in-engine. Optimizing models can also be about ease of animation based on skin weights or bone complexity.</p>
